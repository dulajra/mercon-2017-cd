        <h2>Prof. Nalin Wickramarachchi</h2>
        <h4>Department of Electrical Engineering<br>
            University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka</h4>
        <p>I am pleased to welcome you to Moratuwa Engineering Research Conference 2017. We feel greatly honoured to be
            able to host this International Multidisciplinary Engineering Research Conference for the 3rd consecutive
            time in 2017 at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. In addition to the main two day conference program,
            several keynote addresses and a series of workshops have been arranged to enhance the educational value of
            the event.</p>
        <p>MERCon was included in SCOPUS last two years and it was considered as a big step towards its international
            credibility. This time around, the conference has indeed proved that to be the case by attracting high
            quality papers from 18 countries other than Sri Lanka, representing all regions in the world. Out of a total
            of 539 authors who submitted 183 papers for evaluation, the breakdown is 24% international and 76% local
            authorships. Among the 91 accepted papers, 15 international countries are represented leaving the
            international to local authorship ratio unchanged. The acceptance ratio was about 50%. Congratulations to
            the organisers who could be proud of this achievement in such a short while!</p>
        <p>Success of a research conference like the MERCon is eventually measured by its acceptance by the peers as a
            reliable and useful source of high quality research output. Acceptance by peers is in turn measured nowadays
            by its citation counts such as h-index. I am confident that MERCon will scale this hurdle too in not so
            distant future.</p>
        <p>Let me wind up by expressing my sincere thanks to all the authors, reviewers, sponsors and MERCon committee
            members who contributed to make MERCon 2017 a success. I sincerely hope that you will greatly benefit from
            the workshops, keynote addresses and technical presentations organised for you during these three days.</p>

        <h2>Dr. H.M.N. Dilum Bandara</h2>
        <h4>Department of Computer Science and Engineering<br>
            University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka</h4>
        <p>On behalf of the Program Committee, it is with great pleasure that I welcome you to the MERCon 2017 technical
            program at the Civil Engineering Complex of the University of Moratuwa.</p>
        <p>The program includes 91 papers selected from 183 submissions. The Program Committee (PC) of 43 distinguished
            experts used a single-blind review process. A three-member panel reviewed each paper, where each panel
            consisted of at least one reputed international researcher. Moreover, all papers underwent a similarity
            check with the help of the EDAS conference management system. When applicable authors were given an
            opportunity to justify their similarity score, and papers with satisfactory justifications (as determined by
            the PC) were considered for further processing. Only two papers did not receive a satisfactory
            justification. The PC meet once a week for the last four months and almost every day within the last two
            weeks. Paper acceptance/rejection decisions were based on reviewer comments, and weighted average of paper
            ranking and reviewer confidence level. All reviews and additional comments from the PC meeting were released
            to the authors. We hope that this information will help all authors improve their research, regardless of
            the outcome for their submission. Camera-ready papers were further scrutinized for addressing the reviewer
            comments and template compliance.</p>
        <p>The conference includes 15 sessions on Big Data, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing; Biomedical
            Engineering and Instumentation; Chemical and Process Engineering; Civil and Environmental Engineering;
            Energy and Environmental Engineering; Engineering Mathematics & Statistics; Machine Vision and Image
            Processing; Materials Science and Engineering; Mechanical Engineering Systems; Micro/Nano Electro Mechanical
            Systems, Mechatronics, and Micromechatronics; Power Systems, Electrical Machines and High Voltage
            Engineering; Robotics and Control; Signal Processing and Telecommunication Systems; Software Engineering;
            Technology Management; Textile and Apparel; and Transport and Logistics Management. In addition to the paper
            presentations, the program includes the poster session of the “ERU Symposium”. We are also particularly
            excited about the four keynote talks. The first keynote by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Christoph Bayer of the Technical
            University of Applied Sciences Nürnberg, Germany discusses about “Process Design and Information Systems”.
            Prof. Srikantha Herath of the United Nations University, Japan talk about initiatives taken to manage Urban
            Water in Metro Colombo. Two plenary talks by Dr. Darshana Muthumuni of the Manitoba HVDC Research Centre,
            Canada and Dr. Susumu Sugiyama of the Ritsumeikan University, Japan focus on more technical discussions on
            “Power Outages and Large-Scale Renewable Energy Penetration ” and “Environmental Friendly Polymer MEMS
            Technology ”, respectively. MERCon further hosts six workshops on contemporary topics such as Integrating
            Renewable Energy Resources: PSCAD-Based Network Integration Studies (by Dr. Darshana Muthumuni, Manitoba
            HVDC Research Centre, Canada); Waste Water Treatment Fundamentals, Plant Monitoring, and Operations (by Dr.
            P.G. Rathnasiri, University of Moratuwa); Modeling and Simulation of MEMS/NEMS Based Smart Devices and
            Systems (by Dr. Y.W.R. Amarasinghe, University of Moratuwa); Photovoltaic Power Conversion Systems: Current
            Trends (by Dr. Dulika Nayanasiri, University of Moratuwa); Modelling Wireless Sensor Networks with Network
            Simulator 3 (by Dr. Rajiv Pandey, Amity University Lucknow Campus, India); and Writing, Publishing,
            Presenting, and LaTeX (by Dr. Ranga Rodrigo, University of Moratuwa). We hope that all technical sessions,
            poster session, keynotes, and workshops will enable attendees to get exposure to the whole program and delve
            into the detailed contributions of the papers with their authors during the conference.</p>
        <p>The MERCon 2017 program is the result of the hard work of the PC and TPC members, IEEE student branch of the
            University of Moratuwa, Postgraduate students, as well as ERU and University support staff that sacrificed a
            significant portion of their busy academic and professional time to provide service to our university and
            the research community. I am grateful for their professionalism in all aspects of their duties. I would also
            like to thank the external reviewers for their thorough reviews, often at a very short notice. I am
            particularly thankful to the PC members that diligently shepherded papers, working closely with the authors.
            I would also like to recognize all volunteered to be session chairs during the conference. Moreover, I would
            also like to recognize the co-sponsorships by the IEEE, IEEE Sri Lanka Section, Sri Lanka Section chapter of
            IEEE Power and Energy Society, Sri Lanka Section chapter of IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, and
            Faculty of Graduate Studies of the University of Moratuwa. Furthermore, I would like to recognize the
            support and encouragement from the Vice Chancellor, Deputy Vice Chancellor, Dean Engineering, Heads of
            Departments, Directors of Divisions, and Faculty members of the University of Moratuwa. Finally yet
            importantly, I would like to thank all the authors that submitted papers to MERCon 2017. The strong program
            is a reflection of a thriving research community with hard working members with broad interests.</p>
        <p>I hope you all enjoy the technical program of MERCon 2017 and the opportunity to exchange ideas and interact
            with colleagues as much as I have enjoyed being part of delivering it.</p>
