                REGAINING SRI LANKA THROUGH SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION
                <br>
                -Engineering Research and the J-SLIP initiative-
            </b>
            </h4>
            <hr/>

            <p><strong>Regaining Sri Lanka </strong>implies mobilizing our strengths as a diverse nation of peoples with
                a rich cultural heritage to face the future with creativity and optimism. The presentation views science
                and technology innovation<strong> (STI)</strong> as a neutral platform that can bring our peoples
                together in shaping such a future. <strong>Engineering research</strong> is a key ingredient of this
                endeavour and <strong>MERCon 2016 </strong>offers us an opportunity to explore into and initiate this
                transformation. This presentation is structured into<strong> three parts</strong>, viz. (1) The <strong>transdisciplinary
                    context </strong>of future engineering research and STI; (2) The prospects offered by the <strong>J-SLIP
                    initiative </strong>for balanced regional development; and (3) The design and execution of <strong>two
                    propulsive projects</strong> related to human health and well-being</p>
            <p>The first part outlines the <strong>transdisciplinary context</strong> in which this new era for
                engineering research and STI in Sri Lanka has to be fostered. Sri Lanka&rsquo;s transition to good
                governance (&lsquo;yahapalanaya&rsquo;) has to overcome some formidable political hurdles but this
                burden will be eased considerably if it takes against a background of balanced spatial development and
                sustainable economic growth. It is noteworthy that the government has committed itself to steer this
                growth in keeping with the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs). Legislation to facilitate this in
                developing the five development regions delineated in the government&rsquo;s 60-month programme is
                currently being initiated, possibly the first country in the world to make such an explicit commitment
                to the SDGs. The Sri Lankan President&rsquo;s presentation to the G7 summit members in May this year,
                where Japan as Chair has suggested taking up Sri Lanka&rsquo;s development challenges in a special
                session, is likely to discuss the progress of this 60-month programme in the context of the SDGs and
                quality infrastructure development.</p>
            <p>The second part looks at <strong>STI in the context of balanced regional development</strong>.
                Recognizing that if left unaddressed regions where STI talent gravitates to, conventionally the large
                metropolitan regions, will link up quickly with the global value chain and draw away from the rest of
                the nation&rsquo;s hinterland regions, which could rapidly depopulate and lose economic impetus.
                Articulating a circulatory relationship between <strong>Technology Driver</strong> regions and <strong>Technology
                    Test Bed </strong>regions, this section proposes a solution to the issue of spatial disparities in
                well being in the national landscape. STI-driven engineering research, if coupled with global
                partnerships of excellence, can hasten Sri Lanka&rsquo;s entry into the global value chain. Towards this
                end, this section will outline the ideas underlying the <strong>Japan-Sri Lanka Innovation Platform
                    (J-SLIP)</strong>, born out of the recent Declaration of Joint Comprehensive Partnership between the
                Prime Ministers of Japan and Sri Lanka in October 2015. Plans are under way for presenting the projects
                incubated under the J-SLIP initiative at a forum of scientists, both domestic and international, from
                8-10 September this year. At this Forum, the <strong>Science and Technology for Society (STS) Forum in
                    Sri Lanka (2016)</strong>, organized by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research, the
                prospects for engineering research to power Sri Lanka&rsquo;s development towards an advanced economy
                will be the focus of much discussion.</p>
            <p>Against the above background of Sri Lanka&rsquo;s national development and the J-SLIP initiative,
                <strong>two propulsive projects</strong> from the speaker&rsquo;s laboratories will be discussed from
                the perspective of: <strong>(a)</strong> Inspiration and the timeline of evolution; <strong>(b)</strong>
                the underlying science and trans-disciplinary project design; and<strong> (c)</strong> anticipated
                outcomes and their societal and environmental impacts. The first project is in the emerging field of
                <strong>agro-photonics</strong>. It originated with an STI-driven search for agricultural adaptation to
                climate change but has since evolved into what could well become an important preventive health
                initiative. The second project aims at alleviating hardships associated with <strong>debilitating
                    disease</strong>. Stroke treatment in the acute care phase is the focus of this project, which has
                tremendous implications for downstream treatment and patient outcomes. Both these projects involve the
                marriage of engineering and medical research in driving the STI. Of particular relevance to this
                conference is how both projects navigate between fundamental and applied research, involve partnerships
                between advanced and emerging/developing economies, using the concept of <strong>&lsquo;creative
                    utilitarianism&rsquo;,</strong> an imperative for driving innovative research in developing and
                emerging economies. The modalities common to both projects, although they are from widely different
                subject areas, will be discussed with a view towards <strong>replicability</strong> and <strong>up-scaling</strong>
                as well as <strong>implementation in a local, customized context</strong>. Such propulsive projects,
                address several SDGs simultaneously.</p>
            <p>The presentation concludes by emphasizing <strong>why</strong> technologically advanced economies, like
                Japan, need to partner with developing and emerging economies. The above projects indicate
                <strong>how</strong> this might be done under the umbrella of an STI platform like J-SLIP.</p>

            <p>Data Engineering promotes an engineering approach to anlyse big &ldquo;imperfect&rdquo; data by creating
                and using new smart algorithms such as Unsupervised Deep Learning, appropriate electronic hardware
                platforms and mechanical/mechatronic/material/ chemical-based approaches to interrogate and acquire
                missing data or information. The talk will focus on this paradigm and provide example algorithms and
                applications from the health sector, for example, neural engineering research on epilepsy and other
                brain deceases, biomechanical approaches and bioinformatics approaches attempting to find solutions to
                hard problems in cancer genomics, plat metabolomics, virus detection and drug characterization
                introducing about 10 on-going PhD projects.&nbsp; Other applications of data engineering, for example,
                operational optimization of smart grids and business analytics will also be briefly presented. At the
                conclusion of the talk information about the UGC-University of Melbourne Elite PhD program will also be

            </h4>
            <hr/>

            <p>Radio-frequency waves, including microwaves, play a crucial role in current wireless systems, both
                communication and biomedical. Millimetre-waves are being seriously considered for the next-generation
                (5G and beyond) communication systems because the expected improvement in throughput cannot be achieved
                only from improvement to coding and other &ldquo;soft&rdquo; techniques and a significant improvement in
                the physical layer enhancement (i.e. hardware) is required. Wi-Fi is reaching its limit in 2.5 GHz band
                and faster millimetre-wave systems such as Wi-Gig will become common in households. Recent discoveries
                and advances in photonic crystals, electromagnetic band gap, metamaterials and metasurfaces have
                inspired researchers to consider periodic structures when engineering wave propagation and radiation.
                This keynote speech will outline selected recent developments in these areas of research. It indicates
                how bulky dish antennas in communication systems may be replaced by aesthetically appealing flat
                high-gain antennas, how flexible wearable antennas and implantable antennas can provide comprehensive
                health monitoring in real-time and how steerable beams can provide a better quality of service in future
                wireless networks in homes and offices, including millimetre-wave networks.</p>

            <hr/>

            <p>Use of internet based application in modern society is growing exponentially. Rapid development of
                service automation, social networking and connected devices continues to expand the human activities in
                cyber space resulting in vast quantities of security-critical data being accessible over internet. This
                has in turn caused an explosion of illegal activities such as unauthorized data access, data theft, data
                modification, fraud and various other intrusion activities. To mitigate such risks, intrusion detection
                and response techniques are becoming increasingly critical. We will explore the state of the art in
                advanced intrusion detection as well as intrusion response processes that aim to provide real time
                protection to current computer systems and networks.</p>
