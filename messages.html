            <p class="text-justify ">Since last year (2015) MERCon publications are visible in the SCOPUS
                database/index. This is a significant achievement because SCOPUS is increasingly being used by many
                agencies to judge the research performance of both individuals and institutions. Both the THES (Times
                Higher Education Supplement) and QS (Quacquarelli Symonds) university ranking systems use SCOPUS. For
                this reason the University of Moratuwa is moving towards treating SCOPUS as a benchmark for quality
                publications. So MERCon’s inclusion in SCOPUS is indeed a big step towards its international
                credibility; it will also probably attract progressively better quality papers in years to come,
                including overseas ones.
            </p>
            <p>Research metrics are now being used worldwide to reward research performance, and we must all be aware of
                such moves. Even in Sri Lanka, we could see research allowances being based on metrics such as the
                h-index in time to come. Google Scholar is the most popular database/index and most of us may be aware
                of our h-indices on Google Scholar. We will probably find that our corresponding h-indices on SCOPUS are
                somewhat lower. This is because SCOPUS is more discriminating in its selection of sources for inclusion.
                Younger researchers with long careers in front of them must take cognizance of such realities.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of the day however, the quality of research will improve not primarily through researchers
                being monitored via metrics, but rather through the internal motivation of researchers themselves who
                work to self set standards in order to achieve excellence. Excellence however, is not easy to find or
                define, as Socrates’ friend, Meno, discovered...
            </p>
            <p><i>
                “And how are you going to search for this [i.e. excellence], Socrates, when you don’t have the faintest
                idea what it is? Which of the things that you don’t know will you suppose that it is, when you are
                searching for it? And even if you do come across it, how are you going to know that this is the thing
                you didn’t know?”

                On behalf of the Program Committee, it is with great pleasure that I welcome you to the MERCon 2016
                technical program at the Civil Engineering Complex of the University of Moratuwa.
            </p>

            <p>
                The program includes 76 papers selected from 155 submissions. The Program Committee (PC) of 31
                distinguished experts used a single-blind review process. A three-member panel reviewed each paper,
                where each panel consisted of at least one reputed international researcher. Moreover, all papers
                underwent a similarity check with the help of TurnItIn facility provided by the University Library. When
                applicable authors were given an opportunity to justify their similarity score, and papers with
                satisfactory justifications (as determined by the PC) were considered for further processing. Only two
                papers did not receive a satisfactory justification. The PC meet once a week for the last four months
                and every day within the last two weeks. Paper acceptance/rejection decisions were based on reviewer
                comments, and weighted average of paper ranking and reviewer confidence level. All reviews and
                additional comments from the PC meeting were released to the authors. We hope that this information will
                help all authors improve their research, regardless of the outcome for their submission.
            </p>
            <p>
                The conference includes 12 sessions on Big Data and Software Engineering; Biomedical Engineering and
                Soft Computing; Micro/Nano Electro Mechanical Systems, Mechatronics, and Micromechatronics;
                Telecommunication Systems; Mechanical Engineering Systems; Civil and Environmental Engineering;
                Transport, Logistics and Technology Management; Materials Science and Engineering; Power Systems,
                Electrical Machines and High Voltage Engineering; Chemical and Process Engineering; Machine vision and
                Image Processing; Robotics and Control. In addition to the paper presentations, the program includes the
                poster session of the “ERU Symposium”. We are also particularly excited about the four keynote talks.
                The first keynote by Prof. Monte Cassim of the Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, Japan discusses
                about the possibility of “Regaining Sri Lanka Through Science and Technology Innovation - Engineering
                Research and the J-SLIP Initiative”. Prof. Saman K. Halgamuge of the University of Melbourne, Australia
                talk the all possibilities when Data Engineering Meets Health. Two plenary talks by Prof. Karu Esselle
                of the Macquarie University, Australia and Prof. Jagath K. Samarabandu of the Western University of
                Canada focus on more technical discussions on “Engineering Radio Waves for Future Wireless Communication
                and Biomedical Systems” and “Dynamic Network Security- Intrusion Detection and Response”, respectively.
                We hope that all technical sessions, poster session, and keynotes will enable attendees to get exposure
                to the whole program and delve into the detailed contributions of the papers with their authors during
                the conference.

                The MERCon 2016 program is the result of the hard work of the PC members, IEEE student branch of the
                University of Moratuwa, Postgraduate students, as well as ERU and University support staff that
                sacrificed a significant portion of their busy academic and professional time to provide service to our
                university and the research community. I am grateful for their professionalism in all aspects of their
                duties. I would also like to thank the external reviewers for their thorough reviews, often at a very
                short notice. I am particularly thankful to the PC members that diligently shepherded papers, working
                closely with the authors. I would also like to recognize all volunteered to be session chairs during the
                conference. Moreover, I would also like to recognize the co-sponsorships by the IEEE, IEEE Sri Lanka
                Section, Sri Lanka Section chapter of IEEE Power and Energy Society, Sri Lanka Section chapter of IEEE
                Robotics and Automation Society, the National Science Foundation, and University Grants Commission - Sri
                Lanka. Furthermore, I would like to recognize the support and encouragement from the Vice Chancellor,
                Dean Engineering, Heads of Departments, Directors of Divisions, and Faculty members of the University of
                Moratuwa. Finally yet importantly, I would like to thank all the authors that submitted papers to MERCon
                2016. The strong program is a reflection of a thriving research community with hardworking members with
                broad interests.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope you all enjoy the technical program of MERCon 2016 and the opportunity to exchange ideas and
                interact with colleagues as much as I have enjoyed being part of delivering it.
